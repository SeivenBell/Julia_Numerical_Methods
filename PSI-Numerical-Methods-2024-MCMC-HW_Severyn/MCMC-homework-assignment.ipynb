    "a white dwarf star that has a companion star that \"donates\" gas to the white dwarf.  It gradually gains\n",

    "\"energy density now relative to the critical density\", where the critical density is the energy density you need\n",

    "So $\\Omega_M = 1$, $\\Omega_{\\Lambda} = 0$ would be a flat universe containing all matter, while\n",
    "$\\Omega_M = 0.25$, $\\Omega_{\\Lambda} = 0.5$ would be a spatially closed universe with dark energy and matter.\n",
    "Varying these ingredients changes the growth history of the universe, which changes how much the light from a\n",
