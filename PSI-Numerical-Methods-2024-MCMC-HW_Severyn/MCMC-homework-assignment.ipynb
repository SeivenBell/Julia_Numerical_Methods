    "$\\Omega_M = 0.25$, $\\Omega_{\\Lambda} = 0.5$ would be a spatially closed universe with dark energy and matter.\n",
    "Varying these ingredients changes the growth history of the universe, which changes how much the light from a\n",

    "Finally, please try to make a contour plot similar to Perlmutter et al.'s Figure 7.  From your MCMC chain, you can pull out the `Omega_M` and `Omega_DE` arrays, and then create a 2-d histogram.  Once you have a 2-d histogram, you can use the `contour` function to find and plot the contours in that histogram."
